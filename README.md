# NameSampo Web App

Based on [Sampo-UI &ndash; A framework for building semantic portal user interfaces](https://github.com/SemanticComputing/sampo-ui)

Project homepage: https://seco.cs.aalto.fi/projects/nimisampo/en

master branch visible at https://nimisampo.fi

The Sampo-UI framework is being developed by the [Semantic Computing Research Group (SeCo)](https://seco.cs.aalto.fi) 
at the Aalto University, Finland. See the [research page](https://seco.cs.aalto.fi/tools/sampo-ui) for 
more information. 

## Requirements

* [Node.jsÂ® &ndash; a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.](https://nodejs.org/en/) (version 16.13.0)

* [Nodemon &ndash; monitor for any changes in your source and automatically restart your server](https://nodemon.io/)

Note for Linux users: if your home directory is mounted from a network drive, using the [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for installing Node.js highly recommended. 

## Installation

### Local development

Install the dependencies specified in `package.json` (this command needs to be run only once,
  as long as you don't modify the dependencies):

`npm install`

Run client and server concurrently:

`npm run dev`

## Deploy with Docker

These example commands can be used to deploy the server at http://localhost:3006/ in **production** mode. Production mode means in this case that the server listens for API requests at URLs beginning with http://localhost:3006/api/v1/... and additionally serves the client (React app) at http://localhost:3006/. The API docs can be found at http://localhost:3006/api-docs/.

Note that in **development** mode Webpack is used for serving the client, and the server is used only for handling API requests. 

The build argument API_URL must be provided.

### Build
 `docker build --build-arg API_URL=http://localhost:3006/api/v1 -t sampo-web-app-image .`

### Run
 `docker run -d -p 3006:3001 --name sampo-web-app sampo-web-app-image`

### Run with password protected endpoint
 `docker run -d -p 3006:3001 -e SPARQL_ENDPOINT_BASIC_AUTH=your_password --name sampo-web-app sampo-web-app-image`

### Upgrade
```
docker build --build-arg API_URL=http://localhost:3006/api/v1 -t sampo-web-app-image .
docker stop sampo-web-app
docker rm sampo-web-app
docker run -d -p 3006:3001 --name sampo-web-app sampo-web-app-image
```

## Developer guide

 ### Coding style

The [JavaScript style guide, linter, and formatter](https://standardjs.com) module (named "standard" in package.json) is installed by default as development dependency. Do not install or create any additional style definitions or configurations. Instead, install an appropriate [plugin](https://standardjs.com/index.html#are-there-text-editor-plugins) for your text editor. If there are no plugins  available for your favorite editor, it is highly recommended to switch into a supported editor. 

## Documentation

### Client

Sampo-UI's React components are documented [here](https://semanticcomputing.github.io/sampo-ui) using Storybook.

Here is a list of the main JavaScript libraries on which the Sampo-UI client is built on:

* [React &ndash; A JavaScript library for building user interfaces](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Material-UI &ndash; React components for faster and easier web development](https://material-ui.com/)
* [Redux &ndash; A Predictable State Container for JS Apps](https://redux.js.org/)
* [redux-observable &ndash; RxJS-based middleware for Redux](https://redux-observable.js.org/)
* [Reselect &ndash; Selector library for Redux](https://github.com/reduxjs/reselect)
* [React Router &ndash; Declarative routing for React](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/quick-start)
* [react-intl-universal &ndash; React internationalization package developed by Alibaba Group](https://github.com/alibaba/react-intl-universal)
* [deck.gl &ndash; Large-scale WebGL-powered Data Visualization](https://deck.gl) 
* [react-map-gl &ndash; React friendly API wrapper around MapboxGL JS](https://github.com/visgl/react-map-gl) 
* [Leaflet &ndash; a JavaScript library for interactive maps](https://leafletjs.com/) 
* [Cytoscape &ndash; an open source software platform for visualizing complex networks](https://cytoscape.org/)
* [ApexCharts.js &ndash; Open Source JavaScript Charts for your website](https://apexcharts.com/)
* [React Sortable Tree &ndash; A React component for representation of hierarchical data](https://github.com/frontend-collective/react-sortable-tree)
* [Moment.js &ndash; Parse, validate, manipulate, and display dates and times in JavaScript](https://momentjs.com/)

### Backend

The API provided by Sampo-UI's backend includes routes for the following search paradigms: faceted search, 
full text search, and federated full text or spatial search. The API is described using the 
[OpenAPI Specification](https://swagger.io/specification). The same specification is used for both 
documenting the API, and validating the API requests and responses. 

An API documentation with example configuration can been seen [here](https://sampo-ui.demo.seco.cs.aalto.fi/api-docs/).

Sampo-UI's backend is based on the following JavaScript libraries:

* [Express &ndash; Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js](https://expressjs.com/)
* [axios &ndash; Promise based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js](https://github.com/axios/axios)
* [Lodash &ndash; A modern JavaScript utility library delivering modularity, performance & extras](https://lodash.com/)
