# NameSampo Web App

Based on [Sampo-UI &ndash; A framework for building semantic portal user interfaces](https://github.com/SemanticComputing/sampo-ui)

Project homepage: https://seco.cs.aalto.fi/projects/nimisampo/en

master branch visible at https://nimisampo.fi

The Sampo-UI framework is being developed by the [Semantic Computing Research Group (SeCo)](https://seco.cs.aalto.fi) 
at the Aalto University, Finland. See the [research page](https://seco.cs.aalto.fi/tools/sampo-ui) for 
more information. 

## Requirements

* [Node.js® &ndash; a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.](https://nodejs.org/en/) (version 16.13.0)

* [Nodemon &ndash; monitor for any changes in your source and automatically restart your server](https://nodemon.io/)

Note for Linux users: if your home directory is mounted from a network drive, using the [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for installing Node.js highly recommended. 

## Installation

### Local development

Install the dependencies specified in `package.json` (this command needs to be run only once,
  as long as you don't modify the dependencies):

`npm install`

Run client and server concurrently:

`npm run dev`

## Deploy with Docker

These example commands can be used to deploy the server at http://localhost:3006/ in **production** mode. Production mode means in this case that the server listens for API requests at URLs beginning with http://localhost:3006/api/v1/... and additionally serves the client (React app) at http://localhost:3006/. The API docs can be found at http://localhost:3006/api-docs/.

Note that in **development** mode Webpack is used for serving the client, and the server is used only for handling API requests. 

The build argument API_URL must be provided.

### Build
 `docker build --build-arg API_URL=http://localhost:3006/api/v1 -t sampo-web-app-image .`

### Run
 `docker run -d -p 3006:3001 --name sampo-web-app sampo-web-app-image`

### Run with password protected endpoint
 `docker run -d -p 3006:3001 -e SPARQL_ENDPOINT_BASIC_AUTH=your_password --name sampo-web-app sampo-web-app-image`

### Upgrade
```
docker build --build-arg API_URL=http://localhost:3006/api/v1 -t sampo-web-app-image .
docker stop sampo-web-app
docker rm sampo-web-app
docker run -d -p 3006:3001 --name sampo-web-app sampo-web-app-image
```

## Developer guide

 ### Coding style

The [JavaScript style guide, linter, and formatter](https://standardjs.com) module (named "standard" in package.json) is installed by default as development dependency. Do not install or create any additional style definitions or configurations. Instead, install an appropriate [plugin](https://standardjs.com/index.html#are-there-text-editor-plugins) for your text editor. If there are no plugins  available for your favorite editor, it is highly recommended to switch into a supported editor. 

### Configuration and folder structure

The Sampo-UI framework consists of a client and a backend. This repository includes an example  of a user interface with four faceted search perspectives. The perspectives are connected to five existing
SPARQL endpoints using backend configurations. In order to connect to new SPARQL endpoints, the client and the backend need to be configured and modified accordingly.

The general idea of Sampo-UI is that the focus of the client and its configurations is on displaying data. The business logic of fetching the data using various search paradigms is placed on the backend (folder named "server"). To reduce the trouble of passing all configurations and SPARQL queries from the client to the backend, the client and the backend are configured separately. 

It is recommended that you create the files that are specific to your portal in subfolders, 
to separate them from the core files of Sampo-UI. You can just copy the five folders named "sampo" and rename them with the name of your portal to get a starting base for your React components, reducers, and configuration files. As can be seen from the example configurations and SPARQL queries, the variable names used in the SPARQL queries need to match with the variable names in the reducers of the client. The reducers are used to receive the data from the backend. 

The figure below shows the locations different configuration folders and files.

## Documentation

### Client

Sampo-UI's React components are documented [here](https://semanticcomputing.github.io/sampo-ui) using Storybook.

Here is a list of the main JavaScript libraries on which the Sampo-UI client is built on:

* [React &ndash; A JavaScript library for building user interfaces](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Material-UI &ndash; React components for faster and easier web development](https://material-ui.com/)
* [Redux &ndash; A Predictable State Container for JS Apps](https://redux.js.org/)
* [redux-observable &ndash; RxJS-based middleware for Redux](https://redux-observable.js.org/)
* [Reselect &ndash; Selector library for Redux](https://github.com/reduxjs/reselect)

### Backend

The API provided by Sampo-UI's backend includes routes for the following search paradigms: faceted search, 
full text search, and federated full text or spatial search. The API is described using the 
[OpenAPI Specification](https://swagger.io/specification). The same specification is used for both 
documenting the API, and validating the API requests and responses. 

An API documentation with example configuration can been seen [here](https://sampo-ui.demo.seco.cs.aalto.fi/api-docs/).

Sampo-UI's backend is based on the following JavaScript libraries:

* [Express &ndash; Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js](https://expressjs.com/)
* [axios &ndash; Promise based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js](https://github.com/axios/axios)
* [Lodash &ndash; A modern JavaScript utility library delivering modularity, performance & extras](https://lodash.com/)
